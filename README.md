<summary><strong>Encrypt Form</strong></summary>
<img src="./images/EncryptForm.png" width="400">

The Encrypt Form allows encryption by choosing an industry-standard encryption algorithm such as AES or 3DES and providing a strength-enforced password. Password fields are cleared after 30 seconds of inactivity.

- **Generate Random**: generates a random password that satisfies the strength policy.
- **Clear**: erases both password fields.
- **‚Üí**: encrypts the file with the provided password. If lost, the file cannot be decrypted. FileLocker maintains a zero-knowledge policy.
- **üëÅ**: shows or hides the password fields.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Decrypt Form</strong></summary>
<img src="./images/DecryptForm.png" width="400">

The Decrypt Form allows decryption by providing the encryption password. Password field is cleared after 30 seconds of inactivity.

- **‚Üí**: decrypts the file with the provided password, if correct.
- **üëÅ**: shows or hides the password fields.
</details>
